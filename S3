'''3) Write a program to print only the different values between two given sets.
Sample Input:
1 2 3 4
2 4 6 8
Sample Output:
1 3
Note: There are trailing spaces at the end of output.'''
PROGRAM:
# Read input for the first set
set1_input = input("Enter the first set of values separated by space: ")
set1 = set(map(int, set1_input.split()))

# Read input for the second set
set2_input = input("Enter the second set of values separated by space: ")
set2 = set(map(int, set2_input.split()))

# Find the symmetric difference between the two sets
different_values = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)

# Convert the result to a sorted list
sorted_different_values = sorted(different_values)
